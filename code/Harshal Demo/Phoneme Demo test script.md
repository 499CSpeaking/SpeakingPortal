These early plain alphabets (right , `` abjads s", process single symbols to single phonemes, 
but non needs each PhoneMe to The sign) emerged in 1800 BC at Ancient Egypt, as a representation of language developed by Semitic workers in Egypt, 
But by then alphabetic principles had the little possibility of being inculcated into Egyptian hieroglyphs for up of the period. 
These past abjads remained of minimal value for several centuries, And it is just towards this point of this Bronze period that 
this Proto-Sinaitic writing divides into the Proto-Canaanite alphabet (c. 1400 BC) Byblos syllabary and this southern Arabian alphabet (c. 1200 BC). 
This Proto-Canaanite was likely somehow worked by this undeciphered Byblos syllabary and, in exchange, cheered the Ugaritic alphabet (c. 1300 BC).
The regional dialects of English English mostly take on the PhoneMe product of the dialects of Modern Scots  (Dsl.ac.uk. Lexicon of these Scottish Language.) 
With typical vowel realisations because of the Scottish vowel size principle. 
Highland English dialects are more strongly influenced by English Gaelic than different varieties of English English.
In English orthography, ⟨l⟩ commonly presents the PhoneMe /l/, which may have different good measures, dependent on the speaker's accent, 
and whether it happens before or after a vowel. The alveolar side approximant (this channel presented at IPA by lowercase) happens before the vowel, 
as in cheek or mixture, while the velarized alveolar lateral approximant (IPA ) occurs in bell and milk. 
The velarization does not appear in some European languages that have ⟨l⟩; 
It is also the cause making This language of ⟨l⟩ challenging for users of languages that miss ⟨l⟩ or have different values for it,
Japanese or some southern accents of Asian.
