## notes
### avatar
- Animates a 3D mesh instead of an image.
- Very difficult for a user to upload a rigged, textured 3D mesh instead of an image.
- Preselected avatars.
- High customizability of the avatar's emotions, facial features, etc.
- strictly rigged mesh means no strange "visual distortions" like with morphing images.
- Have full control over the scene the avatar is rendered in (can change background, etc).

### technical limitations
- Unable to demo or benchmark this program due to computational limitations.
- This software is computationally expensive and requires special hardware (RTX graphics card), but we can probably create a simpler version.
- Apparently works in "real-time" (demo required to confirm this); can instantly map speech to animation, not sure about the time it takes to record to file.
