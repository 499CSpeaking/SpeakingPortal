## details
- combines a set of images to animate a full face
- more difficult for a user to upload, but has a good amount of customizability
- can change mouth, poses, etc of avatar
- seems very simple to implement
- doesn't use a deep-learning algorithm, uses a simple phoneme detection algorithm.

## technical limitations
- too difficult for us to test this as it is not very portable (works best on macbooks, which we don't have)
- probably around 25 minutes for a 5 minute video (unoptimized?)
- in idea, should be the fastest of the 3 approaches
