### Session 1

    - Error: no duration found on video, FE issue possible
    - Note: when attempting to open the saved video, an encoding issue was returned

#### Feedback
- Need better documentation on how to use the program
- BE-FE video display breaks (To be fixed if time allows)
- Other language text in gentle may cause crashes: System crashed with a french language input to gentle (could have been issues with my laptop)

### Session 2
- No issues with normal inputs
- No issues with garbage inputs
- No issues with numerical inputs
- Using fractions ie, 1/3 in text causes crash
    - Repro Rate: 100%
- Using @ and # in the same sentence works perfectly fine

#### Feedback
- Crash on FE BE when spamming generate button
- Issue using voice Ana
    - Cause could be wrong voice code used for Ana
    - Can be double checked and fixed easily if this is the issue
