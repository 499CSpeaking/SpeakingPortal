8. The Speaking Portal Project:

        CONTEXT: Kukarella text to speech converter gives you easy access to 750 AI voices across 130 languages and accents. 
        Kukarella users can create a professional voiceover in real-time with multiple languages.  
        Imagine that you are listening to a blog post read by an AI voice. You hear the voice, 
        but you also want to see the person who is reading this text, 
        sort of a personal assistant. 
        Today, there are few solutions which can be used to enable this. 
        You can use pre-recorded videos and sync them with the text; or you can use AI to animate photographs of people or hand-drawn images.
         We would prefer the latter one because it gives more freedom to a user.
       
        DESCRIPTION:  The team will build a web app compatible with Kukarellaâ€™s tech stack. 
        The output of the web app should be something that is embeddable into a website, ideally an image or video. 
        The input should ideally be via a web HTTP request or as a JS API. Kukarella's code base is written in TypeScript,
         with a React front-end and a NodeJS Express backend API server; as long as the input is accessible from our backend in some way, it is acceptable. 
        Ideally, for a user,
         the process of creating a speaking portrait would look something like this: 
         The user enters the text he wants to listen to; uploads a photo of a person or illustration of a character who will read the text; 
         selects a language and voice; presses the "speak" button; 
         and then he can watch and listen to the resulting animated image with a voice over.
