## notes
### avatar
- Animates a 3D mesh instead of an image
- Very difficult for a user to upload a rigged, textured 3D mesh instead of an image
- Preselected avatars
- High customizability of the avatar's emotions, facial features, etc
- strictly rigged mesh means no strange "visual distortions" like with morphing images
- Have full control over the scene the avatar is rendered in (can change background, etc)

### technical limitations
- This software is computationally expensive and requires special hardware (RTX graphics card), but we can probably create a simpler version
- with required hardware, can instant convert audio to animation. Actually rendering the video to a file will not be instant.
