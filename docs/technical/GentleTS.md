# GentleTS System
This system is a TypeScript translation of a currently existing system called Gentle. The original system is coded in python, which we have decided not to use due to our project constraints. As such, we opted to convert all of Gentle into a TS version that we could integrate into our system.

### Better UI
- this is the lowest priority component
- as our system will be accessed via Kukarella, we don't really have a need to create a fully working webpage UI
- we should still create one to ensure client>server and vice versa stability
- needs:
    - text box
    - avatar selection section
    - voice selection section
    - submit button
    - video displayed after generation
