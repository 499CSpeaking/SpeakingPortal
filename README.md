## Project Description
Our mission is to develop an API that can interface with Kukarella's text-to-speech service to provide a user with an embeddable video. 
The system will have the following major features:
- Preset avatars the user can choose to animate
- Voice and Language the user can choose for the audio generated by Kukarella's system
- Lipsynced video output corresponding to the text the user writes
- Custom avatars that the user can create with their own uploaded assets

## Project Goal
Our goal with this project is to create a high quality, high efficiency lip-syncing+animation system that can output an embeddable and downloadable video. In addition to this, we aim to learn more about the processes and practices of software development, as well as learning more about the languages we will be using for this project. Finally, we aim to provide users with an experience that is unique, and provide our client with something that both us and them can be proud of.
